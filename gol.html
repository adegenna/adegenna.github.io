    A 4-state variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> that I came up with by chance. You can click to place red states on the grid, or you can start from a random configuration. Interestingly, many states seem to "anneal" to a final state consisting of grains of horizontal/vertical stripes.
